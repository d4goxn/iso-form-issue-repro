Reproduce an issue with isomorphic forms in ReactJS.

See the [SO question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31227517/how-to-handle-early-input-to-isomorphically-rendered-forms/31230408#31230408) for context. I should have filed an [issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4293) instead.

## Setup

```
npm install && npm run build
```

## Run

```
npm start
```
